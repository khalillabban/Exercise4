            <h3>Nourishment:</h3>
            <p>
                A balanced diet is fundamental for your dog's health. Ensure they receive the proper nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Consult your vet to tailor the diet to your dog’s specific breed, age, and activity level. Always provide fresh water.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offer high-quality commercial dog food or a balanced homemade diet.</li>
                <li>Avoid feeding your dog harmful foods like chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, and items containing xylitol.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on your dog's weight and adjust its diet to avoid obesity or malnutrition.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Grooming:</h3>
            <p>
                Regular grooming is key to keeping your dog clean and in good health. It also allows you to check for any skin problems, parasites, or injuries. Grooming requirements vary based on your dog’s breed, coat type, and level of activity.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brush your dog’s coat frequently to remove loose hair and avoid tangles.</li>
                <li>Trim nails regularly to prevent discomfort and overgrowth.</li>
                <li>Clean your dog's ears and teeth to avoid infections and dental issues.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Exercise:</h3>
            <p>
                Regular physical activity is vital for your dog's overall health. Exercise prevents obesity, builds muscle, and provides mental stimulation. The type and amount of exercise your dog needs will vary based on its breed, age, and health condition.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure daily walks to offer both mental and physical stimulation.</li>
                <li>Engage in interactive activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or agility training.</li>
                <li>Consider dog obedience classes or sports for structured exercise and mental engagement.</li>
