    </p>

    <h3>Feeding:</h3>
    <p>
        A balanced diet is crucial for a cat's health. Providing the right mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals is essential. Consult your veterinarian to determine the ideal diet for your cat's breed, age, and activity level. Always ensure fresh water is available.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offer high-quality commercial cat food or a well-balanced homemade diet.</li>
        <li>Avoid feeding your cat chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, or foods containing xylitol, as these can be toxic.</li>
        <li>Monitor your cat's weight and adjust their diet as necessary to prevent obesity or malnutrition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Grooming:</h3>
    <p>
        Regular grooming is important for keeping your cat clean and healthy. It also allows you to check for any skin issues, parasites, or injuries. Grooming needs vary based on breed, coat type, and activity level.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brush your cat's coat regularly to remove loose hair and prevent matting.</li>
        <li>Trim your cat's nails to maintain a comfortable length and prevent overgrowth.</li>
        <li>Clean your cat's ears and teeth to prevent infections and dental issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercise:</h3>
    <p>
        Regular physical activity is necessary for a cat's overall health and well-being. Exercise helps prevent obesity, builds muscle strength, and provides mental stimulation. The exercise needs of your cat will depend on its breed, age, and health status.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engage your cat with interactive toys and playtime to keep them mentally and physically active.</li>
        <li>Use puzzle feeders or food-dispensing toys to encourage activity and mental engagement.</li>
        <li>Provide a cat tree or climbing shelves to give your cat opportunities for climbing and exploring.</li>
    </ul>
